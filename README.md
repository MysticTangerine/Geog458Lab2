# Geog458 Lab2

<p> My API crawler focused on geo-tagged tweets within the United States during two different time periods.<br>
    I recorded tweet data at 7am in the morning then at 9pm at night. I wanted to make this comparison in order<br>
    to spot any potential differences about what people are tweeting about at different times of the day.</p>

## Map Comparison

<p> The first map represents twitter data collected in the morning with the second map being in the evening.<br>
    The two maps with data collected at different times were very similar in appearance only presenting different<br>
    geospatial patterns because the tweets themselves were different so the dots on the map moved slightly.<br>
    Despite the fact that the tweets changed, nearly all of the tweets in the later part of the day were still<br>
    in the same area as the morning, places that are well populated with many people using social media.</p>

## Word Cloud Comparison

<p> The first word cloud represents twitter data collected in the morning with the second word cloud being in the<br>
    evening. The two word clouds differed as different key words were notably larger. In the first cloud we can<br>
    see words such as "Job", "Never", and "Time" were quite popular. This could be due to the time of day as many<br>
    adults are waking up and heading to their jobs. Likewise, in the second word cloud, words such as "Day",<br>
    "Out", and "Up" were seen often. This could be tied to people tweeting about how their day went, being out<br>
    all day before heading home.</p>
