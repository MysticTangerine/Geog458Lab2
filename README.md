# Geog458Lab2

<p> My API crawler focused on geo-tagged tweets within the United States during two different time periods.<br>
    I recorded tweet data at 7am in the morning then at 9pm at night. I wanted to make this comparison i order<br>
    to spot any potential differences about what people were tweeting about at different times of the day.</p>
